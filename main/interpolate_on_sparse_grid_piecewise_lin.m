% INTERPOLATE_ON_SPARSE_GRID interpolates a function on a sparse grid, i.e. evaluates the sparse  
% grid polynomial approximation (surrogate model) on a generic point of the parameters space.

% F_VALUES = INTERPOLATE_ON_SPARSE_GRID(S,SR,FUNCTION_ON_GRID,NON_GRID_POINTS) evaluates the

%       SR is the reduced version of S. 
%       FUNCTION_ON_GRID is a matrix containing the evaluation of F on the points of SR.

%       NON_GRID_POINTS is the set of points where one wants to evaluate the sparse grid polynomial  
%       approximation. It is a matrix, each column is a different point (i.e. the same convention as 
%       points stored in the knots field of S and SR).
%       F_VALUES is a matrix containing the evaluation of the vector-valued function F 
%       in each of the non_grid_points. Its dimensions are: V x number_of_non_grid_point

    % we could just loop on the interpolation points of the current tensor grid, 
    % and for each one evaluate the corresponding lagrangian polynomial on
    % the set of non_grid_points, but this is not convenient. Actually doing this we recompute the same thing over and over! 
    % think e.g. of the lagrangian functions for the knot [x1 y1 z1] and
    % for the knot [x1 y1 z2]: the parts on x and y are the same!
    
    % Therefore we evaluate each monodim_lagr just once and save all these
    % evaluations in a cell array. We will combine them suitably afterward.
    %
    % Such cell array stores one matrix per direction, i.e. N matrices.

        % allocate space for evaluations. Since I will be accessing it one lagrangian polynomial at a time
        % i.e. one knot at a time, it's better to have all information for the same lagrange polynomial
        % on the same column, for speed purposes. Moreover, note that whenever K=1 (one point only in a direction)
        % then the lagrange polynomial is identically one
        % mono_lagr_eval{dim}=ones(nb_pts,K); %<----------------  this is not needed
        
        % if K>1 %<----------------  this is not needed
            % loop on each node of the current dimension and evaluate the corresponding monodim lagr polynomial.
            % We will need an auxiliary vector to pick up the current knot (where the lagr pol is centered) and
            % the remaining knots (where the lagr pol is zero). Here we see that mono_lagr_eval it's written
            % one column at a time
            aux=1:K;

            end
        % end %<----------------  this is not needed

    end
    
    % now put everything together. We have to take the tensor product of
    % each of the monodim lagr pol we have evaluated. That is, we have to
    % pick one column for each matrix in the cell array and dot-multiply them.
    % all the possible combinations have to be generated !
    %
    % once this is done, we have the evaluation of each multidim lagr
    % polynomial on the non_grid_points, which we will then multiply by the
    % corresponding nodal value and eventually sum everything up.

    % We start by generating the combination of column we need to take. We actually don't
    % need to generate them, but only to recover it from the matrix knots,
    % which already contains all the points of the grid, i.e. all the
    % combinations of 1D points!
    %
    % Given a matrix of points like
    %
    % knots=[a1 a1 b1 b1 a1 a1 b1 b1 ...
    %        a2 b2 a2 b2 .....
    %        
    % combi is
    %
    % combi=[1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 ...
    %        1 2 1 2 ......
    %
    %
    % again, we exploit the fact that the minimum entry of combi is 1 and that for many directions
    % there is only one point, so if we init combi with ones we're good in many cases
  
    combi = ones(N,S(i).size);
    
    % the easiest way to recover combi from knots is to proceed one dimension at a time,
    % and mark with a different label (1,2,...K) all the equal points. We need of course as many labels
    % as the number of different points in each dir!
    
    for dim=1:N
        
        % this is how many points per direction
        % K=length(knots_per_dim{dim});
        K=S(i).m(dim);
        
        % we start from a row of zeroes and we place 1....K in the right
        % positions by summations (each element of the row will be written
        % only once!). Since 1 are already in place, we proceed to place 2 and higher, but only if needed
        if K>1
            for k=2:K
                % here we add to the row of "1" either 0 or (k-1) so we get k where needed
                combi(dim,:) = combi(dim,:)+ (k-1)*( knots(dim,:)==knots_per_dim{dim}(k) ); 
            end
        end
    end


    % Now we can do the dot-multiplications among rows, the
    % multiplication by nodal values and the final sum! We proceed one
    % knot at a time
    
    for kk=1:S(i).size
        
        % dot-multiply all the lagrangian functions according to the
        % combi represented by the current knot. The result F_LOC is a
        % column vector
        
        f_loc=mono_lagr_eval{1}(:,combi(1,kk));
        for dim=2:N
            f_loc=f_loc.*mono_lagr_eval{dim}(:,combi(dim,kk));
        end


        % recover F, the corresponding value for the interpolating function in function_on_grid, with the global counter
        position = Sr.n(global_knot_counter);
        F_value = function_on_grid(position,:);
        
        % add the contribution of this knot to the sparse interpolation.
        % Its contribution is a matrix, since I am evaluating it on a bunch
        % of non_grid_points (one per row of f_values, will be trasposed later), 
        % and my function to be evaluated is vector-valued
        % which gives a bunch of rows in columns in f_values.
        % 
        % we generate this matrix as outer product of f_loc (column vector with lagr pol values) and F_value
        % (row vector with function evaluations)
